            "description": "A new legend begins this fall. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, only on Prime Video Sept 2, 2022. #LOTRonPrime #LOTR #LOTRROP\n---\n\nAbout \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\"\nAmazon Studios’ forthcoming series brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. \n\nBeginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone.",

                "description": "A new legend begins this fall. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, only on Prime Video Sept 2, 2022. #LOTRonPrime #LOTR #LOTRROP\n---\n\nAbout \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\"\nAmazon Studios’ forthcoming series brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and the greatest villain that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. \n\nBeginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf-capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the furthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone."

I think the first trailer released at the end of No Way Home also fills in a lot of the plot too so we'll be going over that and talking about how it teases what's in this one.\n\nIf you enjoy the video then please smash the thumbs up button and also don't forget to subscribe for videos like this every day. With that out the way, thanks for clicking this now let's get into The Multiverse Of Madness.\n\nOk so when we last saw Stephen Strange he was the Doctor Making you forget rather than being the Doctor that you forgot about...Dre.\n\n(What)\n\nIf you look at things from his perspective he has no idea why the multiverse has cracked open as he now no longer remembers P...some..someone from that movie. This is why he's gone to Wanda, who after the events of Westview has been lying low near what may or may not be Mount Wundagore.\n\nIn the first trailer we got a good look at her Garden in which it seemed like she'd planted hundreds and hundreds of white trees. Going off on a big symbolism tangent these in many ways represent the multiple worlds that we will be visiting in the movie. They're all very similar looking but if you get up close you'll notice minor differences to them.\n\nAdding to this metaphor Strange first comes across Wanda pruning branches, terminology that was used in Loki when the TVA talked about shutting down an off shoot timeline.\n\nThe colour white typicall represents peace and in spiritualism it's classed as being something that shows acceptance. The opposite to this is red which is embodied within Wanda's red chaos magic.\n\nMy guess is that initially Wanda will be at peace with losing her children but after she learns variants of them exist within the multiverse that she'll attempt to go after them. Wanda will likely be  the big bad in the movie and in the first trailer we could catch Wong being held up by glowing red magic, probably hinting to her being the main antagonist in the film.\n\nWe of course also have the multiple Doctor Stranges and also Baron Mordo who we'll talk about later on in the video.\n\nIf the darker version is indeed the same one from What If then he will in many ways be a mirror of Wanda as the pair both lost the person they loved. They tried whatever they could to bring them back including completely warping reality and there's a lot of great things that they can do here with both of them.\n\n\n► Artist Attribution\nMusic By KaizanBlu\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/KaizanBlu​\nLicence: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/",
